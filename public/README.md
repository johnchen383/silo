# Silo

#### Scriptural Notetaking, Reimagined.

Silo was born out of a simple desire: to make meditating on God’s Word **clear, intentional, and communal**. Tired of sermon notes piling up or handwriting you can’t read later? Silo helps you **capture your reflections alongside Scripture**, then **share** and **discuss** them with others.  

Think of it as **digital marginalia** — your quiet meditations turned into conversations that inspire, challenge, and help us grow together in Christ.

## Our Why
_"To search the Scriptures, dwell in them daily, and be refined together in Christ"_

<details>
  <summary>1. Search the scriptures</summary>

If the Bereans were around today, we'd hope Silo would be their Bible app of choice. Our heart is to encourage the searching of Scripture — **to think deeply, wrestle honestly, capture insights, and return to them with clarity**.

> “Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.”  
> — **Acts 17:11 (BSB)**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Dwell daily</summary>

We've made it our aim to make getting into the Word **as effortless as possible**. That’s not to say spiritual disciplines aren't needed — but we're convinced our tooling shouldn’t add friction, or at least be the scapegoat we pin our "it's too hard" excuses on.

> “This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.”  
> — **Joshua 1:8a (BSB)**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Refined together</summary>

Scripture reminds us that engaging with the Word was never meant to be just a solo pursuit. Today, community looks different — our neighbours are often a message away rather than a doorstep apart. Silo creates space for those **digital conversations around Scripture** — where reflection becomes dialogue, and faith is sharpened together.

> “Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom.”  
> — **Colossians 3:16a (BSB)**

We’ll also be sharing quarterly video updates. To stay in the loop, [join our mailing list](#), and if you ever miss one, all past updates can be found [here](/about/updates).

## Who's We

I’m John — first and foremost a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a lifelong passion for exploring "blue sky" ideas, especially at the intersection of faith and software. I’m based in Sydney, working as a software developer, studying theology part-time, and building Silo in the bits I have left. If you're ever in the area, [I'm always down to connect and grab a coffee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnc383/).

Over the years I’ve had countless ideas — many never make it past the drawing board, and only a few see the light of day. Silo, however, feels different. I truly believe that, under God, it might transform the way people engage with His Word.
