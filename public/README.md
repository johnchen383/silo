# Silo

> If you're anything like me, taking notes on Scripture often feels unfruitful. I’ve amassed stacks of sermon outlines with notes I scarcely revisit. I've found most digital alternatives also miss the mark — either clunky Bible apps or generic note-takers not built for Scripture. I've also found myself longing for meaningful discussion beyond bible studies or post-service yarns, yet struggle to find spaces where that can naturally happen.

**Silo** is a scriptural note-taking app, designed to make meditating on God’s Word **clear, intentional, and shared**. It helps you **reflect deeply in private**, while keeping your insights **interconnected and easy to revisit**. And when the time is right, you can **share and build on those reflections together** — breaking down the **silos** between our thoughts, our studies, and one another.

Think of it as **digital marginalia** — your quiet meditations transformed into conversations that inspire, challenge, and help us grow together in Christ.

## Mission
_"To search the Scriptures, dwell in them daily, and be refined together in Christ"_

<details open>
  <summary>1. Search the scriptures</summary>

If the Bereans were around today, we'd hope Silo would be their Bible app of choice. Our heart is to encourage the searching of Scripture — **to think deeply, wrestle honestly, capture insights, and return to them with clarity**.

> “Now the Bereans were more noble-minded than the Thessalonians, for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the Scriptures every day to see if these teachings were true.”  
> — **Acts 17:11 (BSB)**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Dwell daily</summary>

We've made it our aim to make getting into the Word **as effortless as possible**. That’s not to say spiritual disciplines aren't needed — but we're convinced our tooling shouldn’t add friction, or at least be the scapegoat we pin our "it's too hard" excuses on.

> “This Book of the Law must not depart from your mouth; meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything written in it.”  
> — **Joshua 1:8a (BSB)**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Refined together</summary>

Scripture reminds us that engaging with the Word was never meant to be just a solo pursuit. Today, community looks different — our neighbours are often a message away rather than a doorstep apart. Silo creates space for those **digital conversations around Scripture** — where reflection becomes dialogue, and faith is sharpened together.

> “Let the word of Christ richly dwell within you as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom.”  
> — **Colossians 3:16a (BSB)**

## Our Edge
<details open>
  <summary>1. Rich scriptural notetaking, without the bloat</summary>
  We're single-minded in our mission to make Silo the most thoughtful way to take notes on Scripture — and nothing else. Capture insights by verse, passage, or theme using text, voice, images, or sketches. Explore how your notes connect and how your thoughts deepen over time.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>2. Elegant, minimalist user-centred design</summary>
  We believe beauty and simplicity matter — especially when engaging with Scripture. A lot of existing apps feel cluttered and unintuitive, distracting from reflection. Silo is designed to be the opposite: calm, elegant, and effortless, so you can focus on what truly matters — the Word itself.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>3. Community oriented</summary>
  We believe Scripture is best understood in community. Silo makes reflection a shared experience — ask questions, share insights, and engage in thoughtful conversation through replies and reactions.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>4. Committed to free access</summary>
  We're convinced that engaging with God's Word should never come at a cost. We endeavour for Silo to remain free for all users, for as long as it remains sustainable. All code is additionally open-sourced under MIT license, in alignment with this commitment. 
</details>
<details>
  <summary>5. Grassroots and community driven</summary>
  We want the team behind Silo to always be approachable. Frankly, we're convinced this is a win-win for the both of us. With your continual feedback and thoughts, Silo gets to be the best version it can possibly be. And with Silo at it's best, we can serve you better via our tooling in our joint plight to know and love God better. Our inbox is always open, and we'll aim to send our raw, unfiltered quarterly updates to take you on the journey. Learn how to get in touch below.
</details>
<details>
  <summary>6. Cross platform and portable</summary>
  Silo is built to work across all major devices, both served via the web and as dedicated mobile apps. Data is seamlessly synced between all devices meaning that you'll never find yourself not having the right device to jot down that thought.  
</details>

## Getting Involved
Silo is currently in its pilot release as we gather feedback and refine the experience before a wider launch.  

If you’re interested in what we’re building — whether that’s from a theological, development, design, or strategy perspective — we’d love to hear from you. You can reach us at **info.silo@gmail.com**.  

We’ll also be sharing quarterly video updates. To stay in the loop, [join our mailing list](#), and if you ever miss one, all past updates can be found [here](/about/updates).

## The Team
> More of a "royal we" at the moment ahaha. Silo is currently a team of uno — though [always on the lookout](#user-content-getting-involved) for like-minded peeps who share the heart behind this project.

I’m John — first and foremost a servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, with a lifelong passion for exploring "blue sky" ideas, especially at the intersection of faith and software. I’m based in Sydney, working as a software developer, studying theology part-time, and building Silo in the bits I have left. If you're ever in the area, [I'm always down to connect and grab a coffee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnc383/).

Over the years I’ve had countless ideas — many never make it past the drawing board, and only a few see the light of day. Silo, however, feels different. I truly believe that, under God, it might transform the way people engage with His Word.
